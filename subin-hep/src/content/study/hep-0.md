# Course Syllabus: Foundations of Modern Particle Physics
**Based on:** *Modern Particle Physics* by Mark Thomson (Chapters 1–4)

## Course Description
This course covers the theoretical and experimental foundations necessary for understanding the Standard Model of particle physics. It focuses on the transition from non-relativistic quantum mechanics to relativistic quantum mechanics, providing the essential "toolkit" for calculating particle decay rates and interaction cross-sections.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1.  Describe the fundamental fermions and bosons of the Standard Model and their interactions.
2.  Perform calculations using Natural Units and Relativistic Kinematics (Four-vectors).
3.  Derive and apply Fermi's Golden Rule to calculate decay rates ($\Gamma$) and cross-sections ($\sigma$).
4.  Understand the derivation of the Dirac Equation and manipulate Dirac spinors.
5.  Explain the concepts of Antiparticles, Spin, and Helicity within the Dirac formalism.
